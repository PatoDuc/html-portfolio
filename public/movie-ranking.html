<h1>The Best movies According to Patricio</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Rango</h3>
<p>Everthing of it is esentially perfect, from the vissuals to the soundtrack. The message and the character development. It has a Clint Eastwood cameo and Johnny Depp stars in it.</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>It has one of the best endings of all time, followed by a wonderful score and an stunning cast with Di Caprio, Page, Hardy, and Cillian Murphy.</p>
<h3>Goodfellas</h3>
<p>Martin Scorcese's masterpiece. A wonderful story about the New York mob with De Niro & Pesci. A masterclass at storytelling and a truly funny letter of love to cinema.</p>
